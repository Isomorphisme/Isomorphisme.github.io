I am a PhD student in mathematics at [Københavns Universitet](https://geotop.math.ku.dk/) under the supervision of [Søren Galatius](https://sorengalatius.com/).

#### **Research Interests**
I am interested in interactions between algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. My current work focuses on using homotopy theoretic methods to uncover homological stability phenomena for moduli spaces coming from complex algebraic geometry. More broadly, I am also interested in moduli spaces of manifolds, embedding calculus and other applications of homotopy theory to geometry. I can occasionally be seen daydreaming about point counting and enumerative geometry.


#### **Preprints**

* [An h-principle for complements of discriminants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00326). *Summary: I investigate the homology of spaces of non-singular algebraic sections of vector bundles on smooth complex projective varieties. In a range, the homology is shown to be that of a more tractable object: continuous sections of an associated bundle. This allows computations using the homotopical arsenal. You can see me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-IGGlVkj0k) talk about this work during the [workshop on configuration spaces](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/calendar/events/hhcs/) at the University of Copenhagen.*
